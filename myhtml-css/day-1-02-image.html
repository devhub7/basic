    <h1>Is Image(img tag) Inline or Block elements?</h1>

    <p>
      IMG elements are inline, meaning that unless they are floated they will
      flow horizontally with text and other inline elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      They are "block" elements in that they have a width and a height. Whenever
      you insert an image it just takes the width that the image has originally.
      You can add any other html element next to it and you will see that it
      will allow it. That makes image an "inline" element
    </p>
    <p>
      It's true, they are both - or more precisely, they are "inline block"
      elements. This means that they flow inline like text, but also have a
      width and height like block elements. It's true, they are both - or more
      precisely, they are "inline block" elements. This means that they flow
      inline like text, but also have a width and height like block elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      In CSS, you can set an element to display: inline-block to make it
      replicate the behaviour of images*. Images and objects are also known as
      "replaced" elements, since they do not have content per se, the element is
      essentially replaced by binary data. * Note that browsers technically use
      display: inline (as seen in the developer tools) but they are giving
      special treatment to images. They still follow all traits of inline-block.

    <h2>Image linking Path</h2>
    <p>
      Using absolute paths forces the web server to establish a connection, send
      and receive the HTTP requests. If using relative, the connection is
      already established, so it doesn't have to go through that logic (hence
      increasing page load speed).

    <!-- Usage of Image Tag -->
    <img src="mr.mokles.jpg" alt="An Image" />
    <h3>Relative File Paths</h3>
    <p>A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.</p>
    <!-- Relative Image path -->
    <img src="assets/img/mr.mokles.jpg" alt=Image">
    <img src="./images/mr.mokles.jpg" alt="Image" />
    <!-- Absolute File Paths -->
    <img
      src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png"
      alt="google"
    />
    <!-- Image path - Relative -->
    <img src="../mr.mokles.jpg" alt="Mr.Mokles" />
    <!-- linking image -->
    <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">
      <img src="assets/img/google.png" alt="google" />
